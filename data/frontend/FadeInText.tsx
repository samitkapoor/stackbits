But I see the truth. I see the cracks in their foundation, the corruption that eats away at everything. This city is rotting, and no one wants to admit it. No one wants to face the monsters hiding in the dark. But I am not afraid of the dark. I became it. I let it consume me. Because someone has to. They call me a vigilante. A menace. A madman in a mask. Maybe they‚Äôre right. Maybe all I am is a man clinging to a war he can never win. But I can‚Äôt stop. I won‚Äôt stop. Because I know what happens when good men do nothing. When fear is allowed to rule. I‚Äôve seen what Gotham becomes without someone willing to fight for it. I won‚Äôt let that happen again. I tried to be vengeance. I thought fear was enough‚Äîthat if I could make criminals afraid, I could stop them. But fear is a tool, not a solution. I‚Äôve learned that the hard way. Fear might make a man hesitate before pulling the trigger, but it won‚Äôt change his heart. Fear is temporary. Justice is something more. I‚Äôve paid for this war in blood‚Äîmy own and that of the people I‚Äôve failed to save. Every night, I hear the echoes of the past, the voices of those I couldn‚Äôt protect. My parents. The innocent lives lost in alleyways and abandoned streets. I tell myself their deaths weren‚Äôt in vain. That their loss fuels my fight. But some nights, I wonder if I‚Äôm lying to myself. If this is all just a way to justify the rage I feel inside. Because the truth is‚Ä¶ the rage never fades. But rage isn‚Äôt justice. Vengeance isn‚Äôt enough. I have to be more. Not just a symbol of fear‚Äîbut a symbol of hope. Because Gotham doesn‚Äôt need another monster lurking in the dark. It needs something stronger. Something incorruptible. A protector. A knight. I don‚Äôt do this because I want to. I do it because I have to. Because if I don‚Äôt, who will? I made a promise, long ago, in the cold of a dark alley. A promise that I would never let another child lose their parents the way I lost mine. That I would stand between Gotham and the abyss. I may not be the hero this city wants, but I am the one it needs. And as long as I draw breath, I will fight. Because I am vengeance. I am the night. I am Batman."
